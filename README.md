# Angular Todo App with Routing Feature

Successfully created my first Angular JS app

- visit https://sunilale0.github.io/angular-todo-and-routing/ for live deployment

Features:

- add todo
- update todo
- delete todo
- check console to if the features are working. I am using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos, so some features don't work for new user inputs

### How to deploy angualar Application to github:

Step 1: `ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href /<project_name>/`
Step 2: make a copy of `docs/index.html` and name it `404.html`. save it in the same folder `docs/` so it has both files `index.html` and `404.html`
